# Adjust-video-from-camera-for-color-blind-people
This app was created for colorblind people, as I one of them ;)
You can use it for adjusting live video, so everyone can see all the infographics on your presentation for example.
It uses a lot of math, so FPS is not great, but I did some good job with numba and njit.
