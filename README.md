# Adjust-video-from-camera-for-color-blind-people
This app was created for colorblind people, as I one of them ;) It allows you to run live video though one of three special filters (for Deuteranope, Protanope and Tritanope), to make objects have enhenced color scheme.
It uses a lot of math, so FPS is not great, but I did some good job with numba and njit.
You can download virtual environment for this algorithm here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vy-08ua8e_xUkx4OLhAfhliL3q4GNDhS?usp=sharing

Here is the same object(bunch of colorfull wires) ran through each filter:
